# What about ALE - is this a plugin that can give me some nice C# features? Looks like it's an LSP client - is it a similar thing to omnisharp?
# investigate if fzf has good-enough support for doing git-stuff from it. If not, is there a nice plugin for it, or can I just write few keymaps?

Looks like those plugins are very powerful. Before installing a new one, I should investigate their functionality first I think.
